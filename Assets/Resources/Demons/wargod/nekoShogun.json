    "name": "Neko Shogun",
    "desc": "The god of prophecy in Taoist religion. It is said to have the head of a cat and the body of a human, and its shrine was located in Annam, which is present-day Vietnam. The shrine was meant for Mao Shangshu, a 14-15th century general who conquered Vietnam. However, because the name \"Mao\" is similar to the Chinese word for cat, the temple was effectively misnamed, and he was reborn as a different god. It should also be noted that there is a similar story about the god of sailing known as \"Tetsu Neko Shogun.\"",
