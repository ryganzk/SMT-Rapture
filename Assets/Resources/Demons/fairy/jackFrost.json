    "name": "Jack Frost",
    "desc": "A frost spirit made from ice and snow that appears during the winter and melts away in the spring. Do not be fooled by his cute demeanor, however, for Jack Frost is known to freeze people with his cold breath, smiling all the while. Some suggest that he originally looked like an abominable snowman, but may have changed form to appear more approachable and thus more easily lure in his victims",
