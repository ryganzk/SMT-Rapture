{
    "name": "Abdiel (Fallen)",
    "desc": "A high-ranking angel that is devoted to God. The name carries the meaning of \"slave to God,\" which supposedly originates from the Arabic word for \"slave\". Of the angels who followed Satan, Abdiel was the only one to reject the temptation to rebel against God, and instead received praise for returning to His side. Abdiel took this form after resolving to protect the order that God created and thus fell to darkness to obtain power greater than that of the angels.",
