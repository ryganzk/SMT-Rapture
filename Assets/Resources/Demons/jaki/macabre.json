    "desc": "An evil spirit appearing in medieval oratorios as the grim reaper. It is truly Death itself, with the power to lead humans to their demise in an instant. It is depicted as a skeleton with a black cloak and a sickle to reap human souls in a single stroke. True to its name, it dances the feared Dance of Death, a reminder that all worldly things must someday meet their end.",
