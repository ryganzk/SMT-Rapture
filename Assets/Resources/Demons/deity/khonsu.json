    "desc": "The Egyptian god of the moon. Often portrayed as a mummy with two long braids of hair, he is said to be a reincarnation of the moon itself and holds possession over what's known as the moon ship. He also acts as a companion to the Pharaoh's shadow. Hieroglyphics found in Unas' pyramid depict him as a god who prepares meals for an oppressive, god-devouring king.",
