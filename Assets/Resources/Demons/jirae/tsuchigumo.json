    "desc": "Monsters said to come from the bastardization of certain clans of Japan. The word carries the literal meaning of \"dirt spider.\" Those who did not pledge allegiance to the Imperial Court were called this derogatory term because of their short stature and spindly limbs. As time passed, people may have misinterpreted the name for a literal meaning and made them into spiders, or perhaps the manifestations of grudges of those who were persecuted by the Imperial Court.",
