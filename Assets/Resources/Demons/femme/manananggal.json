    "name": "Manananggal",
    "desc": "A witch whose lore originated in the Philippines. It masquerades as a beautiful woman during the day but transforms into a blood-sucking monster at night. It has the ability to separate its upper and lower body, and can sprout bat wings from its back to fly in search of humans to suck their blood. It is said that the Manananggal preys on unborn fetuses in particular, using its proboscis-like tongue to open the wombs of pregnant women, wherein it will suck the fetus' blood, or devour it outright.",
