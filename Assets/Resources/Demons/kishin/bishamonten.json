Meru in the center of the world and protects the North under the command of Sakra. He is renowned as a war god since Prince Shotoku prayed to him for victory, and was later incorporated as one of the Seven Gods of Fortune as a deity that protects wealth. He is commonly depicted wearing armor, with a spear in hand and an angry expression on his face.",
