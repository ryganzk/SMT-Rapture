She is often portrayed as an elegant virgin wearing a crown decorated with numerous stars in addition to a golden necklace and a golden cape, and is typically shown holding a water jug. She is also a brave god of war astride a four-wheeled chariot, toppling demons and tyrants alike. Both her allies and her enemies have been said to have offered their prayers to her.",
