    "name": "Artemis",
    "desc": "The Greek goddess of hunting and chastity. She was often identified with the moon goddess Selene and was therefore also worshiped as a moon goddess herself. Like her twin brother, Apollo, her association with archery granted her the title of \"far-shooter\" in addition to being recognized as a bringer of plague and death. This is depicted in myth, in which she is deceived by Apollo and shoots her beloved Orion.",
