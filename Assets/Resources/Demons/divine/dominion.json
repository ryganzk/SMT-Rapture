{
    "name": "Dominion",
    "desc": "The fourth class of angels, ranked first among the Second Sphere. Their name signifies control and rule. Dominions are seen as symbols of mercy and are charged with effecting God's rule over the entire earth. They also serve to convey the will of God to lesser angels and see that it is carried out. They are said to receive orders from the Cherubim, angels of wisdom, and faithfully obey them. The scepters that Dominions always hold in their hands are held to be a symbol representing God's power. In addition to these scepters, they are also sometimes depicted as holding scriptures, swords or scales. The Second Sphere of angels was created by God to serve as the link between the order of the universe and the world of the angels. Their presence and importance are believed to be much lower than that of other angels.",
