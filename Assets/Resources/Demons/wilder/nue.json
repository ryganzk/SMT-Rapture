    "name": "Nue",
    "desc": "A legendary monster in Japanese mythology. It has the head of a monkey, the body of a tanuki, the arms and legs of a tiger, and the tail of a snake. Due to its bizarre appearance, the term \"Nue\" is sometimes used to describe a person of unknown origins. According to The Tale of Heike, the Nue would come to the emperor's palace every night from 2 to 2:30 A.M., shrouded in a dark cloud, where it would howl in a horrific and terrifying manner. However, the warrior Minamoto no Yorimasa eventually shot it down with his bow.",
