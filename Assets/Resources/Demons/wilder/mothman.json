    "name": "Mothman",
    "desc": "A cryptid sighted in West Virginia from the 1960s to 1980s. It has red, shining eyes and was known for the finlike appendages on both sides of its boy. It has been said to walk on two foot and fly without moving these appendages. It has a keen sense for blood which allows it to easily track its prey. Eyewitnesses say that a UFO was sighted when Mothman appeared, so many believe that it is actually an alien.",
