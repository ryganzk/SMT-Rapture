{
    "name": "Hydra",
    "desc": "One of the monsters in Greek mythology. It is usually depicted as having 9 heads, but some may say that it has as many as 100. Its father is Typhon, giant of the wind, and its mother is Echidna, goddess of the snake. The Hydra has incredible regenerating power; so much so that when one of its heads is cut off, two more will sprout from the wound. It is also extremely venomous and simply inhaling its breath is enough to kill. The slaying of Hydra is listed as one of the 12 great labors of Hercules.",
