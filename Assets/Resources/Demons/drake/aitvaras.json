    "name": "Aitvaras",
    "desc": "A fairy in Lithuanian mythology. Indoors, it takes the form of a black cat or rooster. Outdoors, it takes the form of a small dragon or a snake with a burning tail. The Aitvaras makes the home it inhabits rich by stealing from its neighbors. It is said that it typically demands an omelette as compensation and is difficult to chase away once it's settled into a home. It can, however, be exterminated by shining it with the flame of a candle purified by the church.",
