    "name": "Hayataro",
    "desc": "The spirit of a monster-bursting dog that used to live at Kozen-ji. Long ago, the villagers of Mitsuke would offer one of their own girls to a giant monkey yokai to prevent it from ravaging the fields. A monk passing by learned of this and that it greatly feared Hayataro. The monk then rushed off and found him at a temple. Hayataro was offered in place of a village girl, where he then defeated the monster, but was mortally wounded in the epic battle. The loyal dog traveled back to Kozen-ji, where he died shortly after reuniting with his master.",
