    "desc": "One of the four oni controlled by Fujiwara no Chikata, who ruled Iga and Ise during the Heian Period. By suppressing its aura, thereby preventing others from sensing its presence, it can effectively ambush its enemies. Oni have been said to act as liaisons between humans and gods, and the Fudoki holds many records of such exchanges in this region.",
