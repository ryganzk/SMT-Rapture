    "name": "Daemon",
    "desc": "A low-ranking class of spirits. While the name may conjure up familiar images of \"demons\" due to Christianity's influence, daemons were not strictly associated with good or evil and simply thought to be lesser supernatural beings, sometimes acting as tutelary spirits that guided the souls of men. What might be considered a demon today would've been called a \"cacodaemon\" in ancient Greece â€” that is, an evil spirit. In contrast, their benevolent counterparts were known as \"agathodaemons.\"",
