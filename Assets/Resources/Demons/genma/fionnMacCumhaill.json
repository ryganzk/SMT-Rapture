    "name": "Fionn Mac Cumhaill",
    "desc": "The leader of the Fianna, warriors who protected High King Cormac of Ireland. He was born as Deimne, but, due to his blond hair and white skin, he soon came to be called \"Fionn,\" a name meaning \"golden hair.\" When training under the druid, Finn Eces, he was ordered to cook the Salmon of Knowledge, and upon licking some of the salmon's fat from his thumb, he gained its knowledge. From that point on, it is said that Fionn could tap this knowledge any time he licked his thumb.",
