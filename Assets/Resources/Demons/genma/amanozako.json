    "name": "Amanozako",
    "desc": "A Japanese goddess commonly thought to be the ancestor of the Tengu and Amanojaku. The famed warrior Susano-o once allowed his tempestuous spirit to build up to such an intense degree, he vomited her out as a result. Similary to Susano-o, she has a wild personality and tends to go on a rampage if she doesn't get her way. It is said that she can hurl even the most powerful gods a great distance, and that her fangs can mangle the very sharpest of blades. Like amanojaku, she is prone to doing the exact opposite of what is expected.",
