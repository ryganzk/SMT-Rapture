    "name": "Lahmu",
    "desc": "A god that appears in Babylonian mythology. Born from Apsu and Tiamat, he and his sister, Lahamu, gave birth to Anshar and Kishar. Lahmu is at times depicted as a large serpent, but has also been illustrated as a man wearing a red sash with six curls in his hair. Regardless, he is always shown alongside Lahamu and it is thought that together they represent the slit in the sea where Apsu's fresh water and Tiamat's sea water mix.",
