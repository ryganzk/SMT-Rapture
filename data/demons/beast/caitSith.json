    "name": "Cait Sith",
    "desc": "A fae beast from the Scottish highlands whose kingdoms can be found in tree hollows or abandoned houses. Dog-sized, they have white tufts or hair on their chest, green, intelligent eyes, and are even capable of understanding the human language. Though they usually stick to their territory, some have been known to live with humans as normal black cats. They are generally peaceful, but should a human treat one poorly, they will forcibly take that human to their kingdom.",
