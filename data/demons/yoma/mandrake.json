    "desc": "A magical plant whose roots take the appearance of a human. Mandrakes are a precious component in potions to heal sicknesses, but obtaining one is notoriously difficult. When pulled from the ground, they let out a bloodcurdling scream, killing anyone unlucky enough to hear it. There are both male and female variations of Mandrakes.",
